## Distribution of services

- The Figure below shows the proportion of households with improved services over years. The dotted lines represent the household average for each service over the entire study period.


```{R distributions1, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 8}
print(prop_plot)
```

### No. of interviews completed by HH

- If every household was interviewed per year, we would expect $14$ interviews per household. On the contrary, over $40\%$ of the households only had $1$ interview over the entire study period.

```{R fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
print(n_interviews_plot)
```

### No. of interviews per year

- The Figure below shows the percentage of interviews per year.
	- We may need to seek for clarification on low percentage in $2003$ 

```{R fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
print(year_plot)
```

### Status based on the previous year (JD: Status Quo?)

- We track service transitions from the previous year to the current year (within households):
	- **All -**: Service not improved both in the previous and in the current year
	- **All +**: Improved service both in the previous and current year
	- **No prev.**: Had no service in the previous year (missing interview in the previous year)
	- **Gain**: Unimproved service in the previous year but improved service in the current year
	- **Loss**: Improved service in the previous year but unimproved service in the current year

```{R}
print(status_quo_plot)
```

### Household size

```{R}
print(hhsize_plot)
```



## Variables

Distribution of missing cases per variable is shown in the table below

- There are `r nhhid` households, each interviewed once for every interview year
- Study was conducted between $2002 - 2015$. Not all households had interviews conducted in all the years
- Although `hungerscale` and `belowpovertyline` have more proportion of missing cases, `wealthindex` is used as a proxy for the two.

```{R missingness}
datatable(miss_cases_df, rownames = FALSE)
```

- Variables with missing cases are not currently included in the model. A mixed model, `glmer`, with:

- **Fixed effect variables**
	- `age`
	- `gender`
	- `slumarea` - Slum area (Korogocho or Viwandani)
	- `hhsize` - number of people living in the household as at survey
	- `wealthindex` - The wealth index was constructed using principle component analysis (PCA) with input as indicator variables on ownership of household and individual assets/items (such as TV, electricity, fridge, radio, bicycle, motorcycle, shoes, blanket, clothes, etc.), and nature of their housing
	- `StatusP` - Availability of service in the previous year (0/1)

- **Random effect variables**
	- `(services-1|hhid)` - time-independent variation among households
	- \*`(services-1|years)` - household-independent variation across years (not implemented)

- **Response variables**

## Data format choices

There two choices to be made:

- **Consecutive year interviews per household**: We assume that households conducted interviews every year. Consequently, a case missing an interview in the previous (immediate) year is dropped (`r percent_miss_consec`). See the Figure below. Fitted model is based on this.


```{R fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
print(consec_all_plot)
```

- The `r percent_miss_consec` includes first year (specific to household) cases which do not have the previous years. These are dropped by model matrix. Thus the proportion of interviews we are actually dropping due to missing previous (immediate) interviews is `r percent_miss_consec_noyr0`.

```{R, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
print(consec_noyr0_plot)
```

- **Lagged interviews**: Any household interview (most recent) preceding the current household interview is considered consecutive interview. In this case, only interviews in the first year (household specific) will have missing previous year. Consequently, only first year interviews will be dropped (`r percent_miss_lagged`). Not fitted.

- **Thoughts**
	- Fit the first case model and have a separate household specific first year model


## Estimates

- Compared estimates when year is unscaled (mean centered) vs unscaled (but 1 being the ), both for `glmer` and `glmmTMB`.
	- In subsequent analysis, we present `glmer` scaled year estimates

```{R fig.width = 12, fig.height = 16}
print(effectsize_plot)
```



## Predictor effect plots

- These are based on `effects package` - I think based on averaging and conditioning. Couldn't modify JD's effects plots to work for joint models!

```{R}
service_df <- (data.frame(mod_effect_df[["services"]])[, c("services", "fit", "lower", "upper")]
	%>% group_by(services)
	%>% summarise_at(vars(fit:upper), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
)
service_plot <- (ggplot(service_df, aes(x = services, y = fit))
	+ geom_point(size = 0.6)
	+ geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0)
	+ scale_x_discrete(limits = c("watersource", "garbagedposal", "toilettype"))
	+ labs(x = "Service gain"
		, y = "Probability of\nimproved service"
	)
)
```


```{R fig.height=10}
num_vars <- c("age"
	, "hhsize"
	, "year"
	, "wealthindex"
)
num_plots <- lapply(num_vars, function(x){plotEffects(mod_effect_df[[x]], x, x)})
ggarrange(service_plot
	, num_plots[[1]] + rremove("ylab")
	, num_plots[[2]] + rremove("ylab")
	, num_plots[[3]] #+ rremove("ylab")
	, num_plots[[4]] + rremove("ylab")
#	, num_plots[[5]] + rremove("ylab")
	, common.legend = TRUE
	, legend = "bottom"
	, nrow = 3
	, ncol = 2
)
```

```{R fig.height = 8}
cat_vars <- c("statusP", "slumarea", "gender")
cat_plots <- lapply(cat_vars, function(x){plotEffects(mod_effect_df[[x]], x, x)})
p1 <- (cat_plots[[1]]
   + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 1, 0.1, 1, "cm")
      , panel.spacing.x = unit(1, "lines")
   )
)
p2 <- (cat_plots[[2]]
	+ theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 1, 0.1, 1, "cm")
		, panel.spacing.x = unit(1, "lines")
	)
)

p3 <- (cat_plots[[3]]
	+ theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 1, 0.1, 1, "cm")
		, panel.spacing.x = unit(1, "lines")
	)
)
ggarrange(p1 #+ rremove("ylab")
	, p2 #+ rremove("ylab")
	, p3
	, nrow = 3
	, ncol = 1
)
```
