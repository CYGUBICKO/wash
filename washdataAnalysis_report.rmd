## Distribution of services

- The Figure below shows the proportion of households with improved services over years. The dotted lines represent the household average for each service over the entire study period.


```{R distributions1, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 8}
print(prop_plot)
```

### No. of interviews completed by HH

- If every household was interviewed per year, we would expect $14$ interviews per household. On the contrary, over $40\%$ of the households only had $1$ interview over the entire study period.

```{R fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
print(n_interviews_plot)
```

### No. of interviews per year

- The Figure below shows the percentage of interviews per year.
	- We may need to seek for clarification on low percentage in $2003$ 

```{R fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
print(year_plot)
```

### Current vs previous year service status (JD: Status Quo?)

- We track service transitions from the previous year to the current year (within households):
	- **All -**: Service not improved both in the previous and in the current year
	- **All +**: Improved service both in the previous and current year
	- **No prev.**: Had no service in the previous year (missing interview in the previous year)
	- **Gain**: Unimproved service in the previous year but improved service in the current year
	- **Loss**: Improved service in the previous year but unimproved service in the current year

```{R}
print(status_quo_plot)
```

### Household size scaling

- I wasn't sure why I still hard large value after scaling. 
- Do we need to scale household size?
- Should we think of back transforming the predictor effects from effect plots? Is this something sensible?

```{R}
print(hhsize_plot)
```



## Variables

Distribution of missing cases per variable is shown in the table below

- A total of `r nint_all` were done between $2002 - 2015$.
- There are `r nhhid` households, each interviewed once for every interview year
- Not all households had interviews conducted every year
- Although `hungerscale` and `belowpovertyline` have more proportion of missing cases, `wealthindex` is considered a good proxy for the two.

```{R missingness}
datatable(miss_cases_df, rownames = FALSE)
```

- Variables with missing cases are not currently included in the model. A mixed model, `glmer`, with:

- **Fixed effect variables**
	- `age`
	- `gender`
	- `slumarea` - Slum area (Korogocho or Viwandani)
	- `hhsize` - number of people living in the household as at survey
	- `wealthindex` - The wealth index was constructed using principle component analysis (PCA) with input as indicator variables on ownership of household and individual assets/items (such as TV, electricity, fridge, radio, bicycle, motorcycle, shoes, blanket, clothes, etc.), and nature of their housing
	- `StatusP` - Availability of service in the previous year (0/1)

- **Random effect variables**
	- `(services-1|hhid)`
	- \*`(services-1|hhid/years)` - We can talk about this and how much complexity we need (not implemented)

- **Response variables**

## Data format choices

- **Consecutive year interviews per household**: We assume that interviews should have been conducted in every household every year. Consequently, a case missing an interview in the preceding year is dropped. This accounts for `r percent_miss_consec` cases. See the Figure below.


```{R fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
print(consec_all_plot)
```

- The `r percent_miss_consec` includes first year (specific to household) cases which do not have the previous years. First year interviews are excluded and modeled separately (`r percent_year0`). Thus the proportion of interviews we are actually dropping due to missing preceding interview is `r percent_miss_consec_noyr0` of $69\%$ (of all interviews).

```{R, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
print(consec_noyr0_plot)
```

<!-- - **Lagged interviews**: Any household interview (most recent) preceding the current household interview is considered consecutive interview. In this case, only interviews in the first year (household specific) will have missing previous year. Consequently, only first year interviews will be dropped (`r percent_miss_lagged`). Not fitted. -->

## Models

- Fit two separate models
	- First (household specific) year model
	- Previous year model without first year data

**Year 1 model**

- We only have a single observation per HH. I feel we don't need a hh level random effect

	```
	model <- glmer(status ~ -1 
		+ services
		+ (ns(age, 3) 
			+ gender 
			+ slumarea 
			+ hhsize 
			+ year 
			+ ns(wealthindex, 3)
		):services 
		+ (services - 1 | hhid)
		, ...
	)
	```

**Previous year model**

	model <- glmer(status ~ -1 
		+ services
		+ (ns(age, 3) 
			+ gender 
			+ slumarea 
			+ hhsize 
			+ year 
			+ ns(wealthindex, 3) 
			+ statusP
		):services 
		+ (services - 1 | hhid)
		, ...
	)

**Interaction model**

- `wealthindex` interact with all the predictors except `hhsize`
	- The same will apply to year 1 interaction model

	```
	model <- glmer(status ~ -1 
		+ services
		+ (
			(ns(age, 3) 
				+ gender 
				+ slumarea 
				+ year 
				+ statusP
			) * ns(wealthindex, 3) 
			+ hhsize 
		):services 
		+ (services - 1 | hhid)
		, ...
	)
	```

### Year 1 model

- This refers to household specific first observational year
