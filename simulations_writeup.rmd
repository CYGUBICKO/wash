In this simulation, we assume that there are year effects on the intercepts only and consider balanced data for now.

This is a random-intercept or varying-intercepts model simulation
We also have random slopes or varying coefficients
With mixed models we can also estimate the variations among the observed levels

Random assumption on the intercepts

$\alpha_j \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
