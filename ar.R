## We want to simulate an ar(1) random effect
## This means that the mean is zero, and we have some autocorrelation œÅ

## My only question (JD) is do we need to worry about starting point,
## or does the asymptotic distribution already match the error distribution?
## The only issue is in fact the sd, and the sd did need to be adjusted
